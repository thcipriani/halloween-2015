WATâ€½

I get **a LOT** of trick-or-treaters, easily more than 100. Basically,
this is a flask app that will strobe my portch light red, and
play a blood-curdling scream when I open my screen door.

A `POST` to a machine on my local network running `app.py` is triggered
from a Particle Core via `TCPClient` whenever the magnetic door switch
is activated. The flask app handles light-flickering and `Scream.mp3`
playing.

There is also a simple control page (`index.html`) so that I can easily
toggle the light flickering and scream playing. I don't want to emotionally
scar any tiny kids.

I could also maybe do something to turn on a GoPro...maybe...hadn't thought
of it until just now...
